# CSE160-Project-Skeleton-Code

My very poor execution of the project for UC Merced's CSE 165 networking class.

We had 4 projects throughtout the year that we had to build on. Even though most are not implemented fully, they are essential correct and a life lesson on why I will never use nano again. The code runs on TinyOS and is made using nesC.

Project 1: Works Correctly

Project 2: Djikstra's Algorithm is not implemented correctly

Project 3: Does not fill packets properly

Project 4: Was not able to finish
